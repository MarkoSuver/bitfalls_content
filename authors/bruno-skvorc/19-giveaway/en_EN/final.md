We're pleased to announce that we've just received the first batch of custom-made Ledger Nano S devices, Bitfalls branded. We are now an [official Ledger reseller](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/retailers) in Croatia (and worldwide).

To find out what this device is all about, read our very human-friendly explanation [here][ledger].

To celebrate this first wave of products, we're organizing a giveaway in which we'll be sending 2 devices to one lucky winner each. 

To get into the draw pool, first do the following: **sign up for our newsletter**. If you're reading this on your computer or tablet, scroll up to the beginning of the post - the signup form is there. On mobile devices, it'll be at the bottom of the page. Switch the site's language to the language you'd like the newsletter to be written in (it's bilingual just like everything else we publish), then subscribe and confirm your subscription.

After that, to enter each individual draw pool do one (or both) of the following:

1. Like our [Facebook page][fb] and share [this post][fbpost] to your timeline (make sure it's public so we can find it).
2. Follow us [on Twitter][tw] and retweet [this][tweet].

In 5 days we'll draw two random winners from the two pools, one each. Yes, it's possible to win both devices if you're super lucky. We'll send the devices anywhere in the world and we'll also pay for shipping costs.

The contest is over. Unfortunately, it seems many participants didn't read the requirements fully, and failed to sign up for our newsletter ðŸ˜±

Having disqualified those and drawn randomly from the leftover populace, here are the winners:

- Facebook contest: [Sanja MoÄ‡an](https://www.facebook.com/sanja.mocan)
- Twitter contest: [wgrizzlyx](https://twitter.com/wgrizzlyx)

Congratulations! We hope you'll enjoy your Ledgers, guys!

_The winners have been contacted and their Ledgers will be sent out momentarily._

To provide you with the best possible experience during your visits here at Bitfalls.com, without popups, ads, or cookies that track you all over the web, we've decided to try making server-maintenance money via other means: cryptocurrency mining.

In the interest of full transparency, we're using the [CoinHive][coinhive] method which was recently used by [ThePirateBay][tpb]. We're different in that we're letting you know about this in advance, and using a whole lot less of your CPU than TPB did in order not to overheat your device.

We're doing this to cover site maintenance expenses, and all profit that's left over after the company's costs are covered goes to our authors' salaries. We're hoping you'll appreciate our intentions and let us use a bit of your computing power in exchange for good, high quality content which doesn't bombard you with ads.

If this mining is bothering you, you'll find a link at the bottom of the page which will let you turn it off permanently for the device you're reading on. Still, we're hoping enough people will let us use this approach so we can continue to produce good content without having to explore other profit-making venues. We really hate ads.

In time, our intention is to implement user accounts and leaderboards of miner-readers. Additionally, if the profit turns out to be decent enough to sustain us, we're planning to kick back a good part of it to our readers who mine, depending on their contributions. You'll actually be able to earn dividends from our company by simply reading its content.

Thanks in advance!
